3. Remove from the heat, cover and allow to steep for 1 hour
4. Pour the syrup through a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing down to get all of the juice out of the mixture

6. Using a funnel, pour the syrup into a clean 2-liter plastic bottle
7. Add the yeast, lemon juice and remaining 7 cups of water
