[Pastry cream](Pastry Cream.md) (very cold) | 1 1/4 cups
Reduced fat milk | 1/2 cup
Water | 1/2 cup
Salt | 1/4 tsp
Sugar | 1 tsp
Unsalted butter | 1/3 cup
All-purpose flour | 1 cup
Whole eggs | 5

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF and line baking sheet with parchment paper
2. Combine milk, water, salt, sugar and butter in heavy saucepan
3. Place over medium heat until butter melts and mixture comes to a full boil
4. Add flour all at once stirring vigorously with wooden spoon
5. Keep stirring until mixture forms smooth mass and pulls away from sides of pan and some of the moisture has evaporated (about 3 minutes)
6. Transfer to bowl of stand mixer with paddle attachment
7. Mix on medium-high speed and add the eggs one by one (mixture should be thick, smooth and shiny)
8. Use pastry bag with large plain tip to pipe out fingers on baking sheet about 5 inches long and 1 inch wide, spaced 2 inches apart (smooth tails with a damp fingertip)
9. Bake until puffed and starting to show some color (about 10 minutes)
10. Reduce oven temperature to 375ºF and continue to bake until shells feel light, hollow inside and nicely browned all over (about 12 minutes)
11. Remove from oven and poke small holes at each end of the shells using a metal skewer to allow steam to escape
12. Let the shells cool until just warm
13. Use pastry bag with very small plain tip to fill shells with pastry cream from both ends (or split shells in half with serrated knife and spoon the pastry cream on bottom half after glazing upper half)
14. Dip the top of each éclair to glaze then shake gently to allow excess glaze to drip off
